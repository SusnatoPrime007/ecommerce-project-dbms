# ecommerce-project-dbms

This repository contains all the materials used in the making of the E-commerce DBMS-SQL project assigned to us during our elective course INFO3132(Distributed DBMS). 

## Updates Required

1. Remove the online shopping site entity from the ERD diagram as we cannot make the Online Shopping site table with no attributes. Also remove its relationships with other tables.
                  #Update Done

2. @Susnato implement the cardinality changes described in cardinality.md
3. Everyone check [ERD.md](https://github.com/therupdeep/ecommerce-project-dbms/blob/main/ERD.md) and @Susnato design accordingly.
